# DeGooglelize-it!
This repository will collect my steps to degooglelize my life as much as possible.<br>
I am worried about privacy and data sovereignty, so there's a double purpose with this when looking for alternatives to Google services.

Btw there's nothing wrong with Google itself. I think is a great company with awesome products and initiatives. However I am worried about the ammount of information about my persona I am giving for free when using their services. This situation gets even worse if I add it up together with the issue with subscriptions, spam, and everyone trying to profile me when surfing the web.

## Email
I've ditched my old Gmail account and now I am using **Proton Mail** as my email provider.<br>
Link to proton: https://proton.me/

Together with Proton Mail I use DuckDuckGo email protection service: https://duckduckgo.com/email<br>
What the service does is providing random Duck emails linked to a duck account that will forward them to whatever your personal email address is removing any tracking.<br>

```
|-------------------|      |---------------------|        |-------------------------|
| 123asd@duck.com   | ---> |  diazduck@duck.com  |  --->  |  therealthing@proton.me |
|-------------------|      |---------------------|        |-------------------------|
    Random email                My Duck email               My personal Proton mail
                           (of course this is fake)            (and this one too)
```
With this constellation I can use emails for termporal services or stupid subscriptions that ask for it. I created a set of filters in Proton to handle it 
better.

**PROS**
* No more email tracking.
* Encrypted emails when needed.
* Contribute with my money to a company with my same values.

**CONS**
* Rely on DuckDuckGo: it introduces a man in the middle that needs to be audited from time to time.
* Not the most comfortable setup.

## Calendar
At this time I am using Apple Calendar but will migrate to Proton Calendar when there's an iOS app available.

## Drive
Sames as Calendar, from iCloud to Proton Drive when there's an app. At this time Proton offers 15Gb with my subscription which should be enough for my most important documents.

## Web Browser
I switched from Chrome to Safari however that was far from optimal. Since I am using DuckDuckGo email protection I thought I would give a try to their macOS browser. So far so good.<br>

I still have Brave Browser on my radar. I might change in the future.

**PROS**
* Super fast!
* Easy integration with email protection.
* Works all the sites I visit. No problem so far.
* Aligned with my privacy concerns.

**CONS**
* Beta browser.
* At this time an invitation is needed (waiting list is quite short, just a matter of days)
* No bookmark sync, tab grouping and all that stuff I had with Safari.
