# DeGooglelize-it!
This repository will collect my steps to degooglelize my life as much as possible.

## Email
I've ditched my old Gmail account and now I am using **Proton Mail** as my email provider.<br>
Link to proton: https://proton.me/

Together with Proton Mail I use DuckDuckGo email protection service: https://duckduckgo.com/email<br>
What the service does is providing random Duck emails linked to a duck account that will forward them to whatever your personal email address is.<br>

```
|-------------------|      |---------------------|        |-------------------------|
| 123asd@duck.com   | ---> |  diazduck@duck.com  |  --->  |  therealthing@proton.me |
|-------------------|      |---------------------|        |-------------------------|
    Random email                My Duck email               My personal Proton mail
```
With this constellation I can use emails for termporal services or stupid subscriptions that ask for it. I created a set of filters in Proton to handle it 
better.

**PROS**
* No more email tracking.
* Encrypted emails when needed.
* Contribute with my money to a company with my same values.

**CONS**
* Rely on DuckDuckGo: it introduces a man in the middle that needs to be audited from time to time.
* Not the most comfortable setup.

## Web Browser
I switched from Chrome to Safari however that was far from optimal. Since I am using DuckDuckGo email protection I thought I would give a try to their macOS browser. So far so good.<br>

**PROS**
* Super fast!
* Easy integration with email protection.
* Works all the sites I visit. No problem so far.
* Aligned with my privacy concerns.

**CONS**
* Beta browser.
* At this time an invitation is needed (waiting list is quite short, just a matter of days)
* No bookmark sync, tab grouping and all that stuff I had with Safari.
